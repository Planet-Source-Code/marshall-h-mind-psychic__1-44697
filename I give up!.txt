So you can't figure it out?

Well, sit back, and I'll explain.

First, ANY number minus the sum of its digits 
is ALWAYS a multiple of 9.

Example:
57 - 12 = 45
99 - 18 = 81
13 - 4  = 9
23 - 5  = 18

See?

So all the program has to do is assign the 
same symbol to all multiples of nine! The
other numbers are there just to confuse and
confound you.

You always get the symbol that is assigned to
multiples of 9.

Cool, eh?
